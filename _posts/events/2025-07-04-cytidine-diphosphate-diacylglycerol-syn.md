# Cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol synthase 2 is a synthetic lethal target in mesenchymal-like cancers
_Published on Fri, 04 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT_

Abstract
--------

Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs) based on genomic alterations in cancer have been therapeutically explored. We investigated the SLI space as a function of differential RNA expression in cancer and normal tissue. Computational analyses of functional genomic and gene expression resources uncovered a cancer-specific SLI between the paralogs cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol synthase 1 (_CDS1_) and _CDS2_. The essentiality of _CDS2_ for cell survival is observed for mesenchymal-like cancers, which have low or absent _CDS1_ expression and account for roughly half of all cancers. Mechanistically, the _CDS1–2_ SLI is accompanied by disruption of lipid homeostasis, including accumulation of cholesterol esters and triglycerides, and apoptosis. Genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 knockout screens in _CDS1_\-negative cancer cells identify no common escape mechanism of death caused by _CDS2_ ablation, indicating the robustness of the SLI. Synthetic lethality is driven by CDS2 dosage and depends on catalytic activity. Thus, CDS2 may serve as a pharmacologically tractable target in mesenchymal-like cancers.

Whereas healthy cells retain one functional germline _BRCA_ copy, somatic loss of the second copy results in cancer. As _BRCA_ deficiency results in loss of homology-based DNA repair[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR2 "Venkitaraman, A. R.

In addition to genomic alterations, cancers also have distinct gene expression profiles relative to healthy tissue. Publicly available datasets provide extensive transcriptional information as well as genetic dependencies in cancer. For example, the cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) is a comprehensive research initiative providing matched CRISPR screening and gene expression data for 913 cell lines across 30 cancer lineages (2021Q2)[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR33 "Meyers, R. M. et al. Computational correction of copy number effect improves specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens in cancer cells. Nat. Genet. 49, 1779–1784 (2017)."),[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR34 "DepMap, B. DepMap 21Q2 Public. figshare 
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14541774.v2
(2021)."). In addition, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides genome-wide gene expression data for 9,264 tumor and 741 healthy samples[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR35 "Weinstein, J. N. et al. The cancer genome atlas pan-cancer analysis project. Nat. Genet. 45, 1113–1120 (2013)."). Together, these datasets provide 250 million datapoints on gene expression and genetic dependencies in cancer and can be mined to predict SLIs. For example, gene expression data have been used to retrospectively predict patient responses to targeted therapy using computational synthetic lethality analyses[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR29 "Lee, J. S. et al. Synthetic lethality-mediated precision oncology via the tumor transcriptome. Cell 184, 2487–2502.e13 (2021).").

Here, we performed unbiased computational analyses to find cancer-specific SLIs, taking advantage of these public functional genomic and gene expression resources, particularly the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which provides genome-wide gene expression data for 17,382 healthy tissue samples[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR36 "Lonsdale, J. et al. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Nat. Genet. 45, 580–585 (2013)."). We scored all ~340 million gene pairs for synthetic lethality and cancer specificity. We focused on the strong SLI that we uncovered between _CDS1_ and _CDS2_, investigating cancer specificity, robustness of the synthetic lethal relationship in vitro and in mice, potential escape mechanisms, mechanism of cell death and lipidomic and proteomic analysis.

### _CDS1_–_2_ form a common cancer-associated SLI pair

To query for SLIs based on differential gene expression between cancer and normal tissue, we set up a bioinformatic pipeline using public datasets on gene dependencies and RNA expression (Fig. [1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1)). This pipeline identifies anchor–target gene pairs, in which the anchor gene shows a relatively reduced expression level in cancer compared with normal tissue and in which disruption of the target gene results in cancer lethality (Fig. [1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1)).

Although some SLIs may be best detected in single cancer types, we observed that analyzing all cancer types together improved resolution for identifying established interactions (Extended Data Fig. [1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8)). Therefore, we determined the SLI scores for all gene pairs with RNA expression data for all cancer types simultaneously.

The _CDS1_–_CDS2_ and _NAA10_–_NAA11_ gene pairs received high SLI scores (Fig. [1d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1), Extended Data Fig. [1b–e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8) and Supplementary Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)). However, the _NAA10_–_NAA11_ SLI failed to show cancer specificity and was therefore not pursued. In contrast, the _CDS1_–_CDS2_ SLI demonstrated significant cancer specificity. The high SLI score for _CDS1_–_CDS2_ is consistent with other analyses and screens scoring _CDS1_–_CDS2_ as a candidate synthetic lethal pair, but to our knowledge this has not yet been pursued[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR10 "Köferle, A. et al.

CDS1 and CDS2 are enzymes that are conserved in plants and yeast. They serve to convert phosphatidic acid (PA) into cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), conceivably representing the bottleneck in phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthesis[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR41 "Halford, S., Dulai, K.

PI constitutes an essential component of cellular membranes and is also used as a critical kinase substrate regulating cell proliferation and survival[44](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR44 "Goncalves, M.

Our analysis confirmed _FAM50A_–_B_, _DDX3X_–_DDX3Y_ and _EIF1AX_–_EIF1AY_ as cancer-specific SLIs, in agreement with previous reports (Extended Data Fig. [1e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8))[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR10 "Köferle, A. et al.

This is conceivably the result of the relatively low frequency of genomic alterations in _MLH1_ coupled to our focus on transcriptomic rather than genomic data.

In contrast, we noted that _CDS2_ loss was associated with lethality in 19 out of 21 cancer types (Fig. [1e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1)). Several of these concerned common cancers, including lung, blood, brain and skin cancers (Extended Data Fig. [1f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8)). From here onwards, lethality as a function of _CDS2_ loss will be referred to as Δ_CDS2_ lethality. Patients with _CDS1_\-low cancers showed significantly worse survival compared with patients with _CDS1_\-high cancers (Fig. [1f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1)). For these reasons we have focused here on the _CDS1_–_CDS2_ SLI.

To validate and quantify cancer-specific loss of _CDS1_ expression, we compared pan-cancer DepMap expression data and pan-tissue GTEx expression data (Fig. [1g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1)). The data were calibrated on housekeeping genes, while control analyses on reference genes were performed to determine reliability. In line with the TCGA data (Fig. [1d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1)), we observed common absence, or low expression, of _CDS1_ in cancer cell lines compared with healthy tissue (64% average reduction, _P_ < 0.0001). As expected, given the SLI, low or no _CDS1_ expression strongly correlated with Δ_CDS2_ lethality in cancer cell lines (90% average reduction, _P_ < 0.0001). We also observed that lung, blood, brain and skin cancers have reduced _CDS1_ levels compared with their lineages of origin (Extended Data Fig. [1g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8)), suggesting that these cancers may suppress transcription of _CDS1_ during cancer development. For lung cancer, differential CDS1 levels were confirmed using a cohort comprising patient-matched proteomics data from healthy and tumor tissue (Fig. [1h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1))[47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR47 "Satpathy, S. et al. A proteogenomic portrait of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Cell 184, 4348–4371.e40 (2021)."). Thus, our in silico analyses predict that the _CDS1–CDS2_ gene pair constitutes a human cancer-associated SLI, specifically in common _CDS1_\-low cancers.

### _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ are synthetic lethal across cancer types

For wet lab validation of the computational predictions, we used a panel of cancer cell lines, which are also in the DepMap (Fig. [2a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2)). Their _CDS1_ RNA levels were confirmed by quantitative (q)PCR analysis (Fig. [2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2)). Low-throughput CRISPR perturbations were used to quantify the lethality inferred from genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens. By including fluorescent tracker cells serving as an internal control for each experimental condition, we quantified lethality over extended timeframes, showing both minimal variation and the effect size over time (Fig. [2c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2)).

[Source data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM5)

On perturbation of _CDS2_ with one of two separate single guide (sg)RNAs, we were able to confirm Δ_CDS2_ lethality in _CDS1_\-low or _CDS1_\-negative cell lines across several cancer types (Fig. [2d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2) and Extended Data Fig. [2a–c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig9)). Furthermore, as predicted, a _CDS1_\-high cell line was Δ_CDS2_ nonlethal. Compared with the DepMap data, we observed strong lethality. Furthermore, Δ_CDS2_ lethality was still evident in cell lines with low levels of _CDS1_ RNA (Fig. [2d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2), green).

To validate the _CDS1_ dependency of the Δ_CDS2_ lethality, we either ectopically expressed _CDS1_ in _CDS1_\-negative cancer cell lines or perturbed _CDS1_ in _CDS1_\-proficient cancer cells. When _CDS1_ was introduced into two _CDS1_\-negative cell lines, the Δ_CDS2_ lethality was largely negated. Conversely, when _CDS1_ was perturbed in a _CDS1_\-high cell line, it exhibited increased Δ_CDS2_ lethality (Fig. [2e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2)). To validate these observations, we admixed control green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing cancer cell lines with _CDS1_\-restored cell lines in an additional panel of four human melanoma models. The results confirmed strong synthetic lethality on perturbation of _CDS2_ in this panel (Fig. [2f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2) and Extended Data Fig. [2d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig9)). Together, these functional experiments confirm that _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ constitute a synthetic lethal pair across a panel of cancer cell lines in vitro.

### Δ_CDS2_ lethality is associated with apoptosis

We hypothesized that Δ_CDS2_ lethality may result in apoptotic cell death in vitro. To investigate this, we collected samples from BLM and SK-MEL-2 cancer cell lines and measured cleaved caspase-3 by quantitative western blotting as a measure of apoptosis (Fig. [2g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2)). For quantification, the cleaved caspase-3 signal was compared with the total protein signal in the same capillary. As positive controls, we analyzed cleaved caspase-3 levels on induction of apoptosis by TPCA-1 + tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for BLM cells and staurosporine for SK-MEL-2 cells (Extended Data Fig. [2e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig9)). Although it may be possible that, in some settings, other types of cell death may additionally occur, we observed a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 in Δ_CDS2_ cancer cells, indicating that Δ_CDS2_ lethality is associated with tumor cell apoptosis.

### Δ_CDS2_ lethality in vivo

Next, we investigated whether the SLI between _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ observed in silico and in vitro can be recapitulated in vivo. For this purpose, we again admixed control GFP-expressing cancer cell lines with _CDS1_\-restored cell lines. Tumor cells were inoculated into immunodeficient NOD-scid _Il2rγ_\-null mice and analyzed by flow cytometry of the tumors 17 d later. We observed a striking inability of _CDS2_\-perturbed cells to contribute to tumor formation in vivo (Fig. [2h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2) and Extended Data Fig. [2f,g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig9); note that the tumor growth curves are derived from cell mixes including both GFP-expressing and ectopically _CDS1_\-restored cells). Together, these results demonstrate that _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ form a robust synthetic lethal pair in cancer, in silico, in vitro and in vivo.

### No common escape mechanism for Δ_CDS2_ lethality

The computational and in vitro and in vivo functional validation data above demonstrate the broad cancer range and reproducibility of the _CDS1_–_2_ SLI, prompting us to further challenge its robustness. Specifically, the rate-limiting role of the CDS enzymes in PI synthesis led us to investigate whether any cells can rewire their signaling network such that they can escape from this SLI. To investigate this in an unbiased, genome-wide fashion, we performed CRISPR knockout rescue screens in a panel of four _CDS1_\-negative human cancer cell lines and, as a control, one _CDS1_\-high cancer cell line (Fig. [3a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig3) and Supplementary Table [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)). In parallel, cells from the screens were used to track Δ_CDS2_ lethality during the screen. These analyses confirmed Δ_CDS2_ lethality in four _CDS1_\-negative cancer cell lines and extended our data on the lack of Δ_CDS2_ lethality in _CDS1_\-high cancer cell lines to an additional cancer cell line (Fig. [3b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig3)). In addition, colony formation assays were performed to visualize the lethal effect during the screen (Extended Data Fig. [3a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10); note that for K562 a different readout was used, because it is a suspension cell line).

Potential escape mechanisms were determined using Δ_CDS2_ lethality quantified with tracker cells. However, the results of the screens (Fig. [3c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig3) and Extended Data Fig. [3b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10)) indicated no common escape mechanism for Δ_CDS2_ lethality. For example, the screen performed in SK-MEL-2 cells yielded no significant enrichment even after an additional 14 d (32 d in total; Extended Data Fig. [3c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10)), while the other screens yielded only some cell-line-specific rescue (Extended Data Fig. [3d–f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10)). Analysis of the dropout of essential genes confirmed the high quality of the screens (Extended Data Fig. [3g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10)). To comprehensively cover all altered gene expression and DNA mutations, we also analyzed the DepMap for potential escape mechanisms (Fig. [3d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig3)). The results confirm that only _CDS1_ expression commonly affects Δ_CDS2_ lethality. We expanded our Δ_CDS2_ lethality validation to also cover outliers in the DepMap data (Extended Data Fig. [3h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10)): even for these we observed strong Δ_CDS2_ lethality in cultured cancer cells. Although we cannot fully exclude the existence of specific escape mechanisms, together these findings suggest that, at least under the conditions tested in the present study, there are no common escape mechanisms for the combined loss of _CDS1_ and _CDS2_, which is in agreement with the idea that CDS1 and CDS2 together serve as a bottleneck for PI synthesis.

### Mesenchymal-like cancers depend on _CDS2_ for PI synthesis

To understand which cancer types show reduced _CDS1_ expression and, hence, Δ_CDS2_ lethality, we characterized _CDS1_\-low cancers using publicly available data (Fig. [4a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4)). First, we noted that _CDS1_\-high cancer cells express high levels of the epithelial marker gene E-cadherin (_CDH1_), whereas _CDS1_\-low cancer cell lines express mesenchymal markers like _ZEB1_, _ZEB2_ and vimentin (_VIM_) (Fig. [4b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4) and Extended Data Fig. [4a,b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11))[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR48 "Yang, J. & Weinberg, R. A. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis. Dev. Cell 14, 818–829 (2008)."),[49](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR49 "Mak, M. P. et al. A patient-derived, pan-cancer EMT signature identifies global molecular alterations and immune target enrichment following epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Clin. Cancer Res. 22, 609–620 (2016)."). Mechanistically, this is in agreement with the notion that _CDS1_ expression is suppressed in mesenchymal cancers by the transcription factor ZEB1, previously reported to bind the _CDS1_ locus and suppress its expression[50](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR50 "Gemmill, R. M. et al. ZEB1-responsive genes in non-small cell lung cancer. Cancer Lett. 300, 66–78 (2011)."),[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR51 "Feingold, E. A. et al. The ENCODE (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) project. Science 306, 636–640 (2004)."). Therefore, we measured the effect of sgRNAs for _ZEB1_ on _CDS1_ expression by qPCR and computationally scored the correlation between the expression of _ZEB1_ and _CDS1_ or _CDH1_ across cancer types in the DepMap. Both results support the notion that _ZEB1_ suppresses _CDS1_ expression in mesenchymal-like cancers (Fig. [4c,d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4)). Besides this major regulatory mechanism, we also observed that a rare subset of the blood lineage cancer cell lines exhibits methylation of the _CDS1_ promoter (Extended Data Fig. [4c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11)). _CDS1_ methylation did not correlate with _ZEB1_ expression. Overall, these findings indicate that the suppression of _CDS1_ expression in mesenchymal-like cancers by _ZEB1_ results in their strong dependency on _CDS2_ (Fig. [4e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4)).

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that _CDS1_\-low cancers are enriched for the Hallmark epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene set (_P_ = 0.0001 DepMap, _P_ = 0.009 TCGA; Extended Data Fig. [4d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11)). Mesenchymal-transitioned cancers are common, and often highly metastatic and therapy-refractory[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR48 "Yang, J. & Weinberg, R. A. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis. Dev.

Cell 144, 646–674 (2011)."),[53](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR53 "Fischer, K. R. et al. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is not required for lung metastasis but contributes to chemoresistance. Nature 527, 472–476 (2015)."),[54](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR54 "Mani, S. A. et al. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells. Cell 133, 704–715 (2008)."),[55](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR55 "Van Espen, B. et al. RNF185 control of COL3A1 expression limits prostate cancer migration and metastatic potential. Mol. Cancer Res. 21, 41–54 (2024)."). These findings are in agreement with our observations that low _CDS1_ expression is common, more frequent in cancers compared with their healthy tissue of origin and associated with worse survival (Fig. [1e,f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1) and Extended Data Fig. [1g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8)). Furthermore, when expanding this comparison with healthy tissue to 16 cancer types covering _CDS1_ and _CDH1_, we observed that both genes are expressed at low levels in mesenchymal-like cancer cell lines (Extended Data Fig. [4e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11)). Together, these results suggest that suppression of _CDS1_ expression is an integral element of EMT in cancer.

Next, we zoomed in on the pathway in which CDS1 and CDS2 are involved, as has been defined by previous studies (Fig. [4f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4))[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR41 "Halford, S., Dulai, K. S., Daw, S. C., Fitzgibbon, J. & Hunt, D. M. Isolation and chromosomal localization of two human CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) genes. Genomics 54, 140–144 (1998)."),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR42 "Volta, M. et al. Identification and characterization of CDS2, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila CDP-diacylglycerol synthase gene. Genomics 55, 68–77 (1999)."),[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR43 "D’Souza, K., Kim, Y. J., Balla, T. & Epand, R. M. Distinct properties of the two isoforms of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase. Biochemistry 53, 7358–7367 (2014)."),[56](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR56 "Bateman, A. et al. UniProt: the Universal Protein Knowledgebase in 2023. Nucleic Acids Res. 51, D523–D531 (2023)."). We incorporated expression and dependency data from the DepMap for the enzymes involved. In line with the requirement for CDS1 or CDS2, the next enzyme in the pathway, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol synthase inositol-3-phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT), is essential for survival. In addition, _CDS2_ and _CDIPT_ are significantly co-dependent in DepMap cancer cell lines, which is indicative of a similar mechanism of dependency (Fig. [4g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4))[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR28 "Tsherniak, A. et al. Defining a cancer dependency map. Cell 170, 564–576.e16 (2017)."),[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR57 "Wainberg, M. et al. A genome-wide atlas of co-essential modules assigns function to uncharacterized genes. Nat. Genet. 53, 638–649 (2021)."). Accordingly, when supplementing the cell culture medium with exogenous PI, we observed a significant rescue of cell death, suggesting that Δ_CDS2_ lethality is due, at least in part, to insufficient availability of PI (Fig. [4h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4) and Extended Data Fig. [4f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11)).

CDS2 acts upstream of the PI3K signaling module, regulating growth and survival. Unexpectedly, DepMap analysis revealed that Δ_CDS2_ lethality is not accompanied by lethality with either genetic loss of _PIK3CA_ or pharmacological PIK3CA inhibition (alpelisib). Instead, we observed a strong anticorrelation between Δ_CDS2_ lethality and Δ_PIK3CA_ lethality (Fig. [4g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4)). This anticorrelation was independent of PI3K isoforms, as judged by pan-PI3K inhibitor responses. These results demonstrate an essential role of _CDS_ for PI synthesis in mesenchymal cancers. Furthermore, they unexpectedly point to a contribution of _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ to survival signaling independent of the classic PI3K pathway.

### Cholesterol production is induced on _CDS1+CDS2_ ablation

To biochemically define the effects of _CDS2_ perturbation in _CDS1_\-negative cancer cells, we performed multiomic analyses in a panel of four _CDS1_\-negative cancer cell lines and, as a control, one _CDS1_\-high cancer cell line (Fig. [5a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5)). Proteomics was performed to identify deregulated cellular processes on CDS2 loss. In addition, lipidomics was performed to quantify buildup or depletion of lipids, specifically those in the CDS pathway.

**Fig. 5: Cholesterol production is induced on _CDS1+CDS2_ ablation.**

[![figure 5](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-025-02221-2/MediaObjects/41588_2025_2221_Fig5_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2/figures/5)

**a**, Diagram depicting the samples generated for quantifying proteins and lipids (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6)). One _CDS1_\-high cancer cell line and four _CDS1_\-negative cancer cell lines were analyzed. **b**, Average Δ_CDS2_ protein changes for the four _CDS1_\-negative cancer cell lines (_y_ axis) plotted against the Δ_CDS2_ protein changes in the _CDS1_\-high cancer cell line (_x_ axis). The significance was determined using the Student’s _t_\-test. _n_ = 4 replicates for 5 cancer cell lines. An independent experiment repeat using a second independent instrument is shown in Extended Data Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12) for SK-MEL-2. **c**, CDS1 protein levels plotted against CDS2 protein levels for a panel of ten cancer cell lines. _CDS1_ expression from public RNA-seq was added as in Fig. [2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2) (DepMap) with additional data for BLM and SK-MEL-147 (accession no. [SRP132830](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP132830)). For each axis, the relative abundance to the highest cancer cell line included was plotted. Data were normalized to the median levels of calibration proteins and the mean of the experiments was used. CDS1 was detected in all MCF7 and A431 replicates, but no other replicates. _n_ = 3 and 4 replicates from 2 independent experiments.

[Source data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM8)

The proteomics analysis allowed for quantification of ~7,000 proteins in each cell line (Supplementary Table [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)). As expected, the levels of CDS2 protein had dropped tenfold in all five cell lines on _CDS2_ CRISPR perturbation (Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [5a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12)). In addition, large groups of proteins were commonly and significantly down- or upregulated in _CDS1_\-low cancer cell lines, suggesting an orchestrated response (Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [5a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12)). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of these proteins revealed major induction of cholesterol import and production on Δ_CDS2_ lethality (Extended Data Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12)), which was a robust effect across cancer cell lines and different experiments and proteomics analyses (Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [5a,c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12)). Overall, we observed that _CDS2_ perturbation in _CDS1_\-negative cancer cells results in upregulation of cholesterol proteins, including HMGCS1, SQLE, DHCR24, LDLR and SCARB1.

We expanded the proteomics to cover also CDS1 protein by using a different method ([Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Sec13)). As expected, on CRISPR perturbation of _CDS1_, the level of CDS1 protein dropped by 97% (Extended Data Fig. [5d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12)). We observed that CDS1 protein was clearly detected in all replicates in _CDS1_ RNA high cancer cell lines. However, it was not detectable in the _CDS1_ RNA-low or -negative cancer cell lines (log2(transcripts per kilobase per million mapped reads (TPM)) < 3) in a panel of 10 cancer cell lines (Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5)).

### Lipid homeostasis requires either _CDS1_ or _CDS2_ expression

Lipidomic analysis allowed for quantification of the major lipid classes in the cells, with phosphorylated PI (PIP) serving as the major signaling molecule[44](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR44 "Goncalves, M. D., Hopkins, B. D. & Cantley, L. C. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, growth disorders, and cancer. N. Engl. J. Med. 379, 2052–2062 (2018).") (Extended Data Fig. [6a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig13) and Supplementary Table [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)). Major changes as a function of _CDS1_ expression were robustly detected on CDS2 loss (Fig. [6a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6) and Extended Data Fig. [6a–c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig13); note that the stars indicate the number of _CDS1_\-negative cancer cell lines with _P_ < 0.01). For example, cholesterol esters (CEs) and triglycerides (TAGs) were massively upregulated. Furthermore, we observed strong buildup of CDS2 substrates and depletion of the downstream product PI.

**Fig. 6: Lipid homeostasis requires either _CDS1_ or _CDS2_ expression.**

[![figure 6](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-025-02221-2/MediaObjects/41588_2025_2221_Fig6_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2/figures/6)

[Source data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM9)

In line with the buildup of CEs and TAGs, _CDS2_\-perturbed cells formed large lipid droplets[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR58 "Olzmann, J. A. & Carvalho, P. Dynamics and functions of lipid droplets. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 20, 137–155 (2019)."), which were visible by both light and electron microscopy, staining positively for the lipid dyes BODIPY (boron dipyrromethene) and Nile Red. Quantification of BODIPY-stained live cells revealed that on average 3% of the imaged _CDS2_\-knockout cells were made up of lipid (Fig. [6b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6)). Combined light and electron microscopy of fixed cells showed these lipid droplets in more detail (Fig. [6c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6)). Supplementation with the downstream CDS product PI significantly reduced the percentage area of lipid droplets in _CDS2_\-perturbed cells (Fig. [6d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6)). Combined with the lack of lipid droplets with the CDS substrate PA in control cells, this suggests that a shortage of PI drives the formation of most of the droplets. Together, these findings again corroborate that CDS signaling represents a biochemical bottleneck to support lipid homeostasis, demonstrating that lethality upon _CDS2_ perturbation in _CDS1_\-low cell lines is accompanied by major changes in lipid metabolism and induction of the cholesterol pathway (Fig. [6e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6)).

### CDS2 dosage and catalytic activity govern synthetic lethality

Given that our in silico, in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ form a robust synthetic lethal pair in mesenchymal-like cancers, we set out to investigate any favorable characteristics for pharmacological inhibition. First, we investigated the dose dependency of _CDS1–CDS2_ synthetic lethality. Using DepMap data, we observed that the relationship between _CDS1_ expression and Δ_CDS2_ lethality closely follows a dose–response-like relationship (Fig. [7a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7)). Of cancer cell lines, 42% have at least half the maximum synthetic lethality. This is in line with our data linking low _CDS1_ expression to mesenchymal-like cancers and the notion that roughly half of all cancers are mesenchymal like (Fig. [4a–d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4) and Extended Data Fig. [4a,b,d,e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11))[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR59 "Hanahan, D. & Weinberg, R. A. The hallmarks of cancer. Cell 100, 57–70 (2000)."),[60](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR60 "Christofori, G. & Semb, H. The role of the cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a tumour-suppressor gene. Trends Biochem. Sci. 24, 73–76 (1999)."). We used low and high doses of _CDS2_ short hairpin (sh)RNA to generate two levels of _CDS2_ knockdown (Extended Data Fig. [7a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig14)), which confirmed the dose-dependent lethality (Fig. [7b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7)). Together, these data support a dose-dependent essentiality of CDS signaling for survival in cancer cell lines.

**Fig. 7: CDS2 dosage and catalytic activity govern synthetic lethality.**

**a**, The relationship between _CDS1_ expression and Δ_CDS2_ lethality. Deciles for cancer cell line _CDS1_ expression were plotted against Δ_CDS2_ lethality using DepMap data, with variation in Δ_CDS2_ lethality indicated by the interquartile range. A sigmoid curve was fitted through the _CDS1_ expression deciles with _r_ = 0.998. Hill’s equation yielded a log2(TPM + 0.0625) of 1.273 as the level of _CDS1_ expression, with 50% of maximum synthetic lethality among the cancer cell line collection (dashed line). For the totals above and below this level, numbers and percentages are shown on top, together with a histogram of the cancer cell line distribution. _n_ = 913 cancer cell lines (DepMap). **b**, Graph depicting quantification of the 10-d synthetic lethality in BLM using the method for quantifying synthetic lethality with ectopic _CDS1_ or GFP expression described in Fig. [2f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2). Two-way ANOVA followed by Šidák’s test was used. _n_ = 3 replicates for 1 cancer cell line for 3 sh_CDS2_. **c**, Tumor growth after subcutaneous inoculation of control and _CDS2_\-perturbed BLM melanoma cells.

Two-way ANOVA followed by Šidák’s test was used. _n_ = 3 replicates for 2 cancer cell lines. The _CDS2_–GFP and _CDS2_–GFP Asp384Ala cell line variants were each generated in duplicate via independent transductions (no. 1, 2). Δ_CDS2_ lethality in _CDS1_ or _GFP_ variants was replicated in one independent experiment for SK-MEL-2 (Fig. [2e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2)) and two independent experiments for BLM (Fig. [2f](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2): in vitro; Fig. [2h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2): in vivo). **e**, A diagram summarizing the mechanistic aspects of _CDS1–CDS2_ synthetic lethality.

Next, we investigated whether the observed in vivo SLI between _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ can be recapitulated without admixing the cancer cells. For this purpose, tumor cells were inoculated into immunodeficient NOD-scid _Il2rγ_\-null mice. We observed an identical time to establishment of palpable tumors in mice injected with control or C_DS2-_perturbed tumor cells (Extended Data Fig. [7b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig14)). However, robust Δ_CDS2_ lethality manifested in time, again demonstrating the SLI in vivo, now with a homogeneous population of _CDS2_\-ablated tumor cells (Fig. [7c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7)).

In line with the idea that CDS1 and CDS2 form a biochemical bottleneck in lipid homeostasis, we hypothesized that loss of the catalytic activity of CDS2 drives Δ_CDS2_ lethality. To study this, we designed a catalytically inactive variant of CDS2 based on TmCdsA from _Thermotoga_ _maritima_, a thermophilic bacterium, for which this was previously defined (Extended Data Fig. [7c,d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig14))[61](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR61 "Liu, X., Yin, Y., Wu, J. & Liu, Z. Structure and mechanism of an intramembrane liponucleotide synthetase central for phospholipid biosynthesis. Nat. Commun. 5, 4244 (2014)."),[62](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR62 "Yariv, B. et al. Using evolutionary data to make sense of macromolecules with a ‘face-lifted’ ConSurf.

AlphaFill: enriching AlphaFold models with ligands and cofactors. Nat. Methods 20, 205–213 (2022)."). As expected, add-back of either _CDS1_ or catalytically proficient _CDS2_ rescued Δ_CDS2_ lethality compared with the control (Fig. [7d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7)). However, Δ_CDS2_ lethality could not be rescued by add-back of catalytically inactive _CDS2_.

Med. 20, 251–254 (2014)."). Cancers also show distinct gene expression patterns compared with healthy tissue, prompting us to explore the cancer SLI space based on differential gene expression in cancer and healthy tissues. Taking advantage of extensive publicly available cancer datasets, we identified by computational mining that CDS2 serves as a synthetic lethal target in mesenchymal-like cancers. Our bioinformatic pipeline revealed a potential therapeutic index because of differential _CDS1_ expression in cancer cells (low) and normal cells (high). We confirmed that _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ constitute a functional SLI across many cancer types, particularly mesenchymal-like cancers, representing roughly half of all cancers[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR59 "Hanahan, D. & Weinberg, R. A. The hallmarks of cancer. Cell 100, 57–70 (2000)."),[60](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR60 "Christofori, G. & Semb, H. The role of the cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a tumour-suppressor gene. Trends Biochem. Sci. 24, 73–76 (1999)."), including both EMT cancers and cancers with a mesenchymal origin. The SLI is mechanistically explained by the fact that the combined loss of _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ is incompatible with cell survival, which, in combination with the low or absent expression of _CDS1_ in mesenchymal-like cancer cells, results in Δ_CDS2_ lethality (Fig. [7e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7)). Our data are in agreement with results by Chan et al. (reported in the companion paper to this manuscript[64](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR64 "Chan, P. Y. et al. The synthetic lethal interaction between CDS1 and CDS2 is a vulnerability across multiple tumor types. Nat. Genet. 
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02222-1
(2025).")) who reported that _CDS1_ and _CDS2_ are a synthetic lethal gene pair in uveal melanoma.

A series of CRISPR knockout rescue screens not only confirmed the synthetic lethal relationship between _CDS1_ and _CDS2_, but also that they form a bottleneck in a pathway required for PI synthesis that apparently is essential for (cancer) cell viability. We found no common escape mechanism by CRISPR screening and computational analyses. However, ectopic _CDS1_ introduction rescues Δ_CDS2_ lethality and is compatible with cancer cell survival. Taken together, these observations suggest that it may not be straightforward for cancer cells to restore _CDS1_ expression upon inactivation of one of its regulators to rescue cell death on _CDS2_ inactivation. An example is the mesenchymal transcription factor ZEB1, depletion of which induces _CDS1_, but also reduces cancer cell survival[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR33 "Meyers, R. M. et al. Computational correction of copy number effect improves specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens in cancer cells. Nat. Genet. 49, 1779–1784 (2017)."),[50](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR50 "Gemmill, R. M. et al. ZEB1-responsive genes in non-small cell lung cancer. Cancer Lett. 300, 66–78 (2011)."),[51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR51 "Feingold, E. A. et al. The ENCODE (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) project. Science 306, 636–640 (2004)."). Mechanistically, we show that Δ_CDS2_ lethality is associated with cancer cell apoptosis, which can be rescued at least in part by supplementing exogenous PI. The latter is consistent with a requirement for CDS2 to produce PI. Our data also strongly suggest that, unexpectedly, PI synthesis is required for cell survival independent of classic PI3K-dependent survival signaling, because cell lines that depend on _CDS1_ or _CDS2_ for survival did not require PI3K. Our data imply that CDS2 inhibition may be explored to eliminate particularly mesenchymal-like cancers, which are common, highly metastatic and relatively resistant to therapy[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR48 "Yang, J. & Weinberg, R.

To date, no inhibitor is available for CDS2 targeting. However, as our data demonstrate that its enzymatic activity is involved, pharmacological targeting may be possible. For example, for PI3K and diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT), enzymes acting in the same pathway, inhibitors exist, while for PI3K inhibition, isoform-specific inhibitors are also available[46](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR46 "Vanhaesebroeck, B., Perry, M. W. D., Brown, J. R., André, F. & Okkenhaug, K. PI3K inhibitors are finally coming of age. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 20, 741–769 (2021)."). In addition, we observed that essentiality of CDS2 is dose-dependent, indicating that it may be amenable to pharmacological inhibition. As dependency data for healthy tissues are not included in the DepMap data, we cannot exclude that dose-limiting toxicities for CDS2 inhibition may occur. Proliferating fibroblasts are mesenchymal-like, but given that they are mostly involved in wound healing or are cancer-associated[65](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR65 "Kalluri, R. & Zeisberg, M. Fibroblasts in cancer. Nat. Rev. Cancer 6, 392–401 (2006)."),[66](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR66 "Gurtner, G. C., Werner, S., Barrandon, Y. & Longaker, M. T. Wound repair and regeneration. Nature 453, 314–321 (2008)."), their targeting may not cause severe toxicity or even be clinically beneficial. Furthermore, the GTEx data suggest that high expression of _CDS1_ is ubiquitous across healthy tissues while CDS2-targeting morpholinos are tolerated in mice[67](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR67 "Stratman, A. N. et al. Anti-angiogenic effects of VEGF stimulation on endothelium deficient in phosphoinositide recycling. Nat. Commun. 11, 1204 (2020)."). We would propose developing a CDS2-specific inhibitor to maximize the therapeutic index; this may be possible given the different acyl-chain preferences for CDS2 and CDS1 (ref. [43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR43 "D’Souza, K., Kim, Y. J., Balla, T. & Epand, R. M. Distinct properties of the two isoforms of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase. Biochemistry 53, 7358–7367 (2014).")). Clearly, a CDS2-specific inhibitor would be required to determine whether, as our large-scale computational and functional data in vitro and in vivo predict, a therapeutic index for clinically exploiting the _CDS1–2_ SLI indeed exists.

R. Detection of mycoplasma in cell cultures. Nat. Protoc. 5, 929–934 (2010).").

### Cancer-specific synthetic lethality prediction

Briefly, to rank potential synthetic lethal candidate pairs, Pearson’s correlation between fitness data (CERES or Chronos) and messenger RNA expression, proteomics, mutation or methylation data were calculated with 21Q2 or 23Q4 DepMap data[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR34 "DepMap, B. DepMap 21Q2 Public. figshare 
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14541774.v2
(2021)."),[75](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR75 "DepMap, B. DepMap 23Q4 Public. figshare 
https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.24667905.v2
(2023)."). We used Pearson’s _r_ because it measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, in this case anchor gene status and target gene dependency. For methylation and mutation, the ranking is reversed, because more mutation or methylation corresponds with less gene activity (whereas more RNA or protein corresponds with more gene activity). To validate this approach, several positive control, synthetic lethal pairs were selected. Positive control analyses were run using all pairs with the anchor genes.

To identify the most promising new SLIs, the anchored approach was replaced with a genome-wide analysis encompassing 340 million gene pairs. Each pair includes the anchor gene (expression gene) and the target gene (fitness effect gene), respectively. For each pair we calculated Pearson’s correlation between the expression of the anchor gene and Δtarget gene lethality across all cancer cell lines included. From the results, the top pair for each anchor was ranked to form a hit list. All duplicate target genes were removed to avoid false positives arising from anchor gene coexpression with other anchor genes. The change in expression was calculated for each anchor gene in the synthetic lethality prediction using reanalyzed TCGA healthy and tumor RNA data[76](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR76 "Rahman, M. et al. Alternative preprocessing of RNA-sequencing data in the Cancer Genome Atlas leads to improved analysis results. Bioinformatics 31, 3666–3672 (2015)."). Increases in expression were plotted as a 0% reduction in Fig. [1d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1).

To analyze the DepMap for escape mechanisms, we used 23Q4 DepMap data and calculated the partial Pearson’s correlation between the expression of each gene and Δ_CDS2_ lethality across all cancer cell lines corrected for _CDS1_ expression. We did the same for damaging and hotspot mutation data, also correcting for _CDS1_ expression. We corrected for _CDS1_ expression to exclude false positives from _CDS1_ expression coexpressed or co-mutated features.

### Cut-offs used in analyses

For Fig. [1e,g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1) and Extended Data Fig. [1f,g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig8), Δ_CDS2_ lethal cancer cell lines were selected by CERES <−0.5. For context, a CERES of −1 corresponds to the core essential, whereas a CERES of 0 corresponds to the nonessential[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR33 "Meyers, R. M. et al. Computational correction of copy number effect improves specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens in cancer cells. Nat. Genet. 49, 1779–1784 (2017)."). For Fig. [1e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig1), low _CDS1_\-expressing cancer cell lines were selected by log2(TPM + 1) < 1.5. For Fig. [4d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4) and Extended Data Fig. [4b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig11), the cut-offs for high expression were put right before the high peak on the histograms (log2(TPM + 1) of 2.5 for _CDS1_, 4.5 for _CDH1_, 2 for _ZEB1_ and 6 for _VIM_).

### Patient mortality and survival analysis

The 21Q2 DepMap data for cell lines with available RNA and dependency data were used for Δ_CDS2_ lethality. Lineages of patient mortality data and DepMap data were matched manually (Supplementary Table [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)).

### Comparing CDS1 expression between healthy tissue and cancer cell lines

GTEx v.8 TPM was downloaded from the portal on 1 January 2022. The 21Q2 DepMap data were downloaded from the DepMap portal. Calibration genes with available TPM in DepMap and GTEx were used for normalization[77](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR77 "Eisenberg, E. & Levanon, E. Y. Human housekeeping genes, revisited. Trends Genet. 29, 569–574 (2013)."). Up- and downregulation controls were selected from the literature[78](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR78 "Li, M., Sun, Q. & Wang, X. Transcriptional landscape of human cancers. Oncotarget 8, 34534–34551 (2017)."),[79](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR79 "Zehir, A. et al. Mutational landscape of metastatic cancer revealed from prospective clinical sequencing of 10,000 patients. Nat. Med. 23, 703–713 (2017)."). Briefly, the TPM for each calibration gene was normalized to their own average expression. Then the TPM for _B2M_, _CDS1_, _CDKN2B_ and _E2F1_ was normalized to the average of the calibration gene expression. Calibrated results are similar to uncalibrated results as a result of intrinsic total RNA calibration of the GTEx and DepMap dataset TPM data. The analysis was also performed for blood, skin, lung and brain lineage data, with the original labeling from the DepMap and GTEx, also including soft-tissue atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, originally labeled ATRT, in the DepMap brain category. This was expanded to 16 cancer types using minor labeling changes for lineage matching between datasets.

### Healthy and tumor proteome data

Tumor and normal adjacent lung proteome data from Satpathy et al. were downloaded from entry PDC000234 and analyzed[47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR47 "Satpathy, S. et al. A proteogenomic portrait of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Cell 184, 4348–4371.e40 (2021)."). Specifically, log2\-transformed ratios to internal controls were collected and sample names were mapped to their healthy or tumor tissue origin. Before plotting and statistical testing log2\-transformation was undone, resulting in ratios to internal control. The internal control was reported to be a mix of all samples. Still, calibration genes with available ratios in all samples were used for normalization[77](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR77 "Eisenberg, E. & Levanon, E. Y. Human housekeeping genes, revisited. Trends Genet. 29, 569–574 (2013)."). Each calibration gene ratio was normalized to its own average ratio. Then, the ratio for CDS1 was normalized to the geometric mean of the normalized calibration gene ratios for each sample.

### Quantitative PCR to quantify RNA

Three housekeeping genes for calibration were selected from a previously described list of options based on stable pan-cancer cell line expression in the DepMap[77](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR77 "Eisenberg, E. & Levanon, E. Y. Human housekeeping genes, revisited. Trends Genet. 29, 569–574 (2013)."). The qPCR was performed as previously described[80](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR80 "Apriamashvili, G. et al. Ubiquitin ligase STUB1 destabilizes IFNγ-receptor complex to suppress tumor IFNγ signaling. Nat. Commun. 13, 1923 (2022)."). The average of quadruplicate cycle threshold (_C_t) values was calculated for each gene. The −ΔΔ_C_t method was used for analysis: To normalize to calibration genes, the geometric mean of the three calibration gene _C_t values was subtracted from the _CDS1_ _C_t value. To normalize to A431, the _C_t value of A431 was subtracted from the other cell line _C_t values. By base-2 exponential transformation and multiplication by −1, _C_t values were transformed to fold-changes. One representative calibration gene (_VPS29_) was selected and used for Fig. [4c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig4) and Extended Data Fig. [7a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig14). Primer sequences are available in Supplementary Table [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3).

### Lentiviral transduction

Cell lines were lentivirally transduced as previously described[80](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR80 "Apriamashvili, G. et al. Ubiquitin ligase STUB1 destabilizes IFNγ-receptor complex to suppress tumor IFNγ signaling. Nat. Commun. 13, 1923 (2022)."). Transduced cells were always kept on selection during cell culture in vitro. The complete selection was verified by the loss of the control untransduced cells on selection. Low-throughput CRISPR perturbation using pLentiCRISPR v.2 Puro or Blast and ectopic expression using pLX304 Blast (_CDS1_, _CDS2_–_GFP_, _CDS2_–_GFP Asp384Ala_ and GFP)[81](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR81 "Yang, X. et al. A public genome-scale lentiviral expression library of human ORFs. Nat. Methods 8, 659–661 (2011)."), pLKO.1 Puro or pCDH Puro (mCherry) was performed as previously described[82](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR82 "Vredevoogd, D. W. et al. Augmenting immunotherapy impact by lowering tumor TNF cytotoxicity threshold. Cell 178, 585–599.e15 (2019)."),[80](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR80 "Apriamashvili, G. et al. Ubiquitin ligase STUB1 destabilizes IFNγ-receptor complex to suppress tumor IFNγ signaling. Nat. Commun. 13, 1923 (2022)."). SHC002 (shControl) and TRCN00000s ending on 35859, 35861 and 35862 (sh_CDS2_ nos. 1–3) from MISSION TRC-Hs 1.5 (human) were used. The shRNA virus was concentrated 40× (Millipore, cat. no. UFC910024). For high-dose transduction, it was used undiluted (sh_CDS2_ nos. 2 and 3) or 1:10 diluted (sh_CDS2_ no. 1) with a final protamine sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 1101230005) concentration of 8 µg ml−1. For low-dose transductions, it was used 1:100 diluted without protamine sulfate. For Fig. [2e](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2) Blast resistance was introduced to mCherry-transduced cells using pLentiCRISPR v.2 Blast. In Fig. [2d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2), sg_CDS2_ no. 1 and no. 2 were used and for all other experiments sg_CDS2_ no. 2 was used. The sg_CDS1_ was introduced using pLentiCRISPR v.2 Blast. The sgRNA sequences are available in Supplementary Table [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3).

### Cloning _CDS2_–GFP and _CDS2_–GFP Asp384Ala

The pLX304 Blast containing _CDS2_ was edited to generate _CDS2_–GFP and _CDS2_–GFP Asp384Ala[81](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR81 "Yang, X. et al. A public genome-scale lentiviral expression library of human ORFs. Nat. Methods 8, 659–661 (2011)."). Carboxy-terminal GFP was added with a flexible glycine and serine linker sequence (Supplementary Table [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)). The sg_CDS2_ no. 2 target site sequence was altered with silent mutations (Supplementary Table [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)). For the mutant, a nonsilent sequence change was made to encode an Asp384Ala amino acid substitution (5′–3′: GAC → GCC). Cloning involved ligation with T4 DNA ligase, restriction with NheI + SbfI (GFP addition, Asp384Ala mutation) and restriction with XmaI + SbfI (silent mutations). Gene blocks were ordered from IDT and enzymes were from New England Biolabs (NEB). _CDS2_–GFP and _CDS2_–GFP Asp384Ala plasmids are available on request.

### Determining (synthetic) lethality by tracking fluorescent cells

Briefly, after lentiviral transduction (1 d) and puromycin selection of sgRNA-transduced cells (2 d), the indicated cell mixes were prepared. For the in vivo experiments cells were selected 1 d longer. To determine lethality, sgRNA-transduced cells were mixed with non-sgRNA-transduced, mCherry-positive cells. On the day of mixing (day 0) and at the indicated later time points, samples from each cell mix were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the ratio between negative and positive cells. The final ratios were normalized to day 0 ratios and sgControl ratios. For lethality, normalized ratios were transformed into percentages to obtain survival percentages and subtracted from 100 to obtain lethality percentages. To determine synthetic lethality ectopic _CDS1_\- or GFP-expressing cells, both transduced with the same sgRNA, were mixed on day 0. Then, lethality was calculated for the GFP-positive cells in an identical manner as for the mCherry-negative cells. For Extended Data Fig. [3h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig10) and Fig. [7d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7), unmixed mCherry-positive cells were used to determine the fraction of background mCherry-negative cells among the mCherry-positive cells. This fraction was multiplied with the mCherry-positive cell number from each mixed sample and the resulting expected background was subtracted from the respective mCherry-negative cell counts of that sample.

### Flow cytometry

Flow cytometry data were collected on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer, regularly maintained in the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) flow cytometry facility. One of several live or dead dyes was always included: DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. D9542-50MG), PI (Merck, cat. no. 537059-100MG), DRAQ7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. D15106) and fixable near infrared (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. L34976). BSA, 0.1%, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a washing and staining solution. Samples were washed 3× (including resuspension as one wash) in 0.1% BSA in PBS, once for dead cell experiments to preserve dead cells and 6× for in vivo samples to reduce postdigestion debris. The gating strategies used are presented in Extended Data Fig. [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig15).

### Western blotting

Quantitative western blots (Abby) with total protein were prepared and ran according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the manufacturer’s reagents. Cleaved caspase-3 antibody at 1:100 dilution (primary 9664S; CST) and undiluted anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G horeseradish peroxidase (ProteinSimple, cat. no. 042-406) were used. CRISPR-perturbed samples for cell death analysis were split on day 11 and harvested on day 12, both after transduction. Samples for western blotting by simple western blotting were collected as previously described, with the additional inclusion of the floating cell fraction[80](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR80 "Apriamashvili, G. et al. Ubiquitin ligase STUB1 destabilizes IFNγ-receptor complex to suppress tumor IFNγ signaling. Nat. Commun. 13, 1923 (2022)."). As a control, we measured cleaved caspase-3 on induction of apoptosis with 1 µM staurosporine (CST, cat. no. 9953S) in SK-MEL-2 or 200 ng ml−1 of TNF (Immunotools, cat. no. 11343017) + 10 µM TPCA-1 (Selleckchem, cat. no. S2824) in BLM[83](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR83 "Wiernicki, B. et al. Excessive phospholipid peroxidation distinguishes ferroptosis from other cell death modes including pyroptosis. Cell Death Dis. 11, 922 (2020)."),[84](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR84 "Nassour, J. et al. Telomere-to-mitochondria signalling by ZBP1 mediates replicative crisis. Nature 614, 767–773 (2023).").

### TIDE analysis

Genomic DNA was isolated from cell pellets using All-prep DNA/RNA kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A region around the sg_CDS2_ no. 2 target site was amplified using NEBNext High Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequences are available in Supplementary Table [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3). PCR products were purified by Minelute (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sanger sequencing (Macrogen) of each sample was performed in triplicate and chromatograms of each sg_CDS2_ replicate were compared with each of three control sequences. Comparisons were made using the tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) website with settings of insertions and deletions (indels) size range 25 for NCI-H2030, LPS141 and K562 and 30 for SK-MEL-2 and MCF7 (ref. [85](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR85 "Brinkman, E. K., Chen, T., Amendola, M. & Van Steensel, B. Easy quantitative assessment of genome editing by sequence trace decomposition. Nucleic Acids Res. 42, e168 (2014).")). The significance cut-off for calling indels was the default 0.001. The decomposition window was adjusted for each comparison. The frameshift percentage was calculated using the percentage without indels combined with significant indel percentages for multiples of three nucleotides.

### Animal studies

All animal studies were approved by the animal ethics committee of the NKI and performed under approved NKI CCD (Centrale Commissie Dierproeven) projects, according to the ethical and procedural guidelines established by the NKI and Dutch legislation (project no. AVD3010020172464 with protocol ID 9.1.10902 for the experiment in Fig. [2h](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig2) and Extended Data Fig. [2f,g](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig9) and project no. AVD30100202316772 with protocol ID 34.1.11655 for the experiment in Fig. [7c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig7)). Mice were housed in single-use standard cages at controlled filtered air humidity (55%), temperature (21 °C) and light cycle. All housing material, food and water were autoclaved or irradiated before use. Animal husbandry has been previously described[80](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR80 "Apriamashvili, G. et al. Ubiquitin ligase STUB1 destabilizes IFNγ-receptor complex to suppress tumor IFNγ signaling. Nat. Commun. 13, 1923 (2022)."). Synthetic lethality in vivo was quantified like it was in vitro (described above) with the following adaptations: Puromycin selection was not continued in vivo_._ Two million melanoma cell mixes in 1:1 PBS Matrigel prepared on day 0 were injected subcutaneously into the flank of weight-randomized 13- to 15-week-old NOD-scid _Il2rγ_\-null (Jax) mice. Mice were numbered and researchers were blinded from this step onwards. Tumor sizes were measured with calipers and the volume was calculated using length × width × width × 0.5. Tumors were harvested, digested and processed into homogeneous single-cell solutions. Then samples were stained for human B2M (BioLegend, cat. no. 316320) at 1:100 dilution to exclude mouse cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results were normalized to day 0 and sgControl. For each group one sample was unblinded during flow cytometry acquisition to set voltages and gates for all groups. Growth curves from one million subcutaneously injected unmixed melanoma cells were determined in the same manner as for the mixed cells.

### Genome-wide CRISPR perturbation

Screening was performed as published previously[82](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR82 "Vredevoogd, D. W. et al. Augmenting immunotherapy impact by lowering tumor TNF cytotoxicity threshold. Cell 178, 585–599.e15 (2019)."),[86](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR86 "Sanson, K. R. et al. Optimized libraries for CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens with multiple modalities. Nat. Commun. 9, 5408 (2018)."),[87](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR87 "Joung, J. et al. Genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 knockout and transcriptional activation screening. Nat. Protoc. 12, 828–863 (2017)."). The one-vector Brunello library was amplified in liquid culture at 20,000× coverage and maintenance of the original sgRNA distribution was confirmed. Screen cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3–0.7 with polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. TR-1003-G) at 8 µg ml−1. Screens were performed at 200× coverage. Novaseq was used to sequence the screen samples and the amplified Brunello library. Sequencing primers with unique dual indices per sample were used (Supplementary Table [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM3)).

To allow dropout of essential sgRNAs, cells were cultured for 10 d after Brunello library transduction. After this, single sgControl and sg_CDS2_ lentivirus transduction cells were cultured for 18 d. The second-best sgRNA out of four guides was used to calculate the effect size. For SK-MEL-2, comparatively few cells were available as a result of lethality and no hits were detected. To ensure detection of any escape mechanism, a cryopreserved sample from day 7 was cultured until day 32 after single sgControl and sg_CDS2_ transduction, and those results were used for the presented analyses.

The colony formation assays were started with screen cells on day 8. For K562, MCF7, NCI-H2030, LPS141 and SK-MEL-2 cell lines, 125,000, 125,000, 62,500, 31,250 and 125,000 cells were seeded, respectively. The Crystal Violet staining was done when control cells had reached confluence, which was after 4, 14, 12, 7 and 12 d, respectively. A seeding density corresponding to the longest culture time for MCF7 was chosen to ensure maximum sensitivity for detecting a potential difference. For K562 suspension cells, the cells were instead counted with Trypan Blue using an automatic cell counter (BioRad, cat. no. TC20). In addition, lethality was tracked from day 8 until day 19 using tracker cells and used to calculate rescue percentages. The quality control receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) was generated as described previously[86](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR86 "Sanson, K. R. et al. Optimized libraries for CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens with multiple modalities. Nat. Commun. 9, 5408 (2018)."). We used ROC-AUC because it is a standard metric for evaluating CRISPR screen performance, providing a clear measure of how well true positives are distinguished from background noise (true negatives).

### Lethality and synthetic lethality rescue experiments

For the synthetic lethality rescue experiments, the method to track synthetic lethality by tracking GFP positivity was used. The indicated cell mixes were generated 7 d after transduction with sgControl or sg_CDS2_ lentivirus. After overnight attachment, treatment was started and samples were harvested to measure GFP positivity at the starting point. Cells were split and refreshed on day 3 and measured on day 7 after the start of treatment. Phospholipids were complexed with BSA. Stock solutions of 500 µM were generated by incubating phospholipid with 2.5% fatty-acid free BSA from Sigma-Aldrich (cat. no. A8806) in DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h. Liver phosphatidylcholine (PC; cat. no. 840055P-25MG) or PI (cat. no. 840042P-25MG) from Avanti Polar Lipids was used. Final GFP-negative to GFP-positive ratios were normalized to input ratios and sgControl ratios to obtain the synthetic lethal fraction. For rescue, the fold-change in the synthetic lethal fraction was calculated by dividing by the untreated synthetic lethal fractions and transformed into rescue percentages by subtraction from 1 and multiplication by 100. The resulting rescue percentages correspond to the part of the total synthetic lethality that was negated in the treated conditions. For the overnight lethality rescue, CRISPR-perturbed samples for cell death analysis were split on day 11 and harvested on day 12, both after transduction. PI was dissolved in medium and added to the cells at 2 mM.

### GSEAs

Hallmark GSEAs were performed using GSEA v.4.1.0 (Java tool) with the settings h.all.v2022.1.Hs.symbols.gmt, 25,000 permutations and No\_Collapse on Pearson correlations generated as described from DepMap or TCGA data[88](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR88 "Mootha, V. K. et al. PGC-1α-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes. Nat. Genet. 34, 267–273 (2003)."),[89](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR89 "Subramanian, A. et al. Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 102, 15545–15550 (2005)."). Gene set enrichment for the GO term processes was performed using the Stringdb ‘multiple proteins’ function on the list of 37 genes significant only in the 4 _CDS1_\-negative cell lines[90](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR90 "Szklarczyk, D. et al. STRING v11: protein–protein association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets. Nucleic Acids Res. 47, D607–D613 (2019).").

### Lipidomics

Quantitative targeted lipidomics was carried out using a flow-injection assay employing lipid class separation by differential mobility spectroscopy and selective multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) per lipid species (Lipidyzer platform). A detailed description of lipid extraction, software and the quantitative nature of the approach can be found elsewhere[91](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR91 "Ghorasaini, M. et al. Cross-laboratory standardization of preclinical lipidomics using differential mobility spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring. Anal. Chem. 93, 16369–16378 (2021)."),[92](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR92 "Ghorasaini, M. et al. Congruence and complementarity of differential mobility spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy for plasma lipidomics. Metabolites 12, 1030 (2022)."),[93](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR93 "Su, B. et al. A DMS shotgun lipidomics workflow application to facilitate high-throughput, comprehensive lipidomics. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 32, 2655–2663 (2021)."). Briefly, after the addition of >60 deuterated internal standards, lipids were extracted using methyl _tert_\-butyl ether. Organic extracts were subsequently dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in running buffer. Lipids were subsequently analyzed using flow injection in MRM mode employing a Shimadzu Nexera series HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatograph) and a Sciex QTrap 5500 mass spectrometer. For further analysis, lipidomic data normalized to cell number were used to calculate the quadruplicate fold-changes for plotting and statistical analysis.

### Proteomics

A detailed sample- and data-processing protocol for generating the proteomic results is available in [Supplementary Note](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#MOESM1). For plotting Fig. [5b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [5a,c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12), log2\-transformed protein group abundances were used that were available for each cell line in at least four out of four replicates in the sgControl or sg_CDS2_ sample group. Differentially expressed proteins were determined using a two-sided Student’s _t_\-test (thresholds: _P_ < 0.05). For plotting Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig5) and Extended Data Fig. [5c](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig12), fold-changes relative to the average protein abundance per experiment were calculated for CDS1, CDS2 and calibration proteins. Then, for the CDS1 and CDS2 proteins, the fold-change to the median calibration protein levels per sample was calculated. For the CDS1 and CDS2 proteins, the fold-change to average abundance by experiment was recalculated and, respectively, replicates and experiments were averaged. With the combined data, the relative abundance of the CDS1 and CDS2 proteins to the highest included cancer cell line was calculated and plotted.

### Light microscopy

Live cells stained with BODIPY (2 µM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. D3922) were imaged on a regularly maintained Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope at the NKI imaging facility using phase contrast and fluorescence equipment. A home-built, temperature-controlled, live-cell chamber and 5% CO2 incubation system were used. Data were analyzed using custom ImageJ code. Briefly, for each condition, the low complexity area on phase contrast was excluded to calculate cell area and BODIPY fluorescence was used to calculate the lipid area. Cell lines were imaged 14 d (SK-MEL-2) or 20 d (NCI-H2030) after transduction (Fig. [6b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#Fig6)). For imaging, cells were seeded several days in advance in a twofold dilution series of seven steps. At the time of imaging, different conditions were imaged at a similar density using the available dilution series.

### Electron microscopy

Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) was performed as described before[94](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR94 "Grootemaat, A. E. et al. Lipid and nucleocapsid N-protein accumulation in COVID-19 patient lung and infected cells. Microbiol. Spectr. 10, e0127121 (2022)."),[95](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02221-2#ref-CR95 "Bedard, M. et al. A terpene nucleoside from M. tuberculosis induces lysosomal lipid storage in foamy macrophages. J. Clin. Invest. 133, e161276 (2023)."). Briefly, for CLEM 150- to 300-nm cryosections of cells were placed on to an EM grid, stained with Nile Red (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 72485) and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. H3570) and imaged with a Wide-field Fluorescence Microscope (Leica DM6, ×100 oil objective). After washing and contrasting for EM purposes, the identical grid was imaged using a transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Talos, cat. no. L120c with a Ceta 16M camera).

### Statistics and replication

Significance was tested and depicted as indicated. Two-sided tests were employed. To ensure reproducibility, we addressed experimental variation by including multiple replicates and biological variation by including multiple cell lines and we employed multiple methods whenever possible. Replicates were generated during the same period in time and independent experiments were performed during different moments in time. For admixing, experimental replicates were cultured independently from the start to the finish. The assumption of normality was kept at a minimum by using nonparametric tests for large datasets (Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney _U_ test). Data processing was always verified by a second researcher. Complex bioinformatic analyses were redone independently.
